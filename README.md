# About me

I'm Emanuel Luis, _aka_ **@tiov4d3r**, 20 years old and from Maranhão, Brazil. My goals are to become a software developer, also I'm interest in game and web development, currently studying Software Engineering, but mostly time I am studying in home by myself, so I can be better qualified to the market of technology. Lately I've been developing my own projects as long as I get into the subjects, so I can improve better and faster, and also develop some soft skills like standardization of projects and programming logic.
